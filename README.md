# Getting Started with Create React App

## How to Submit Pull Requests
1- Clone the project, and create and checkout new branch `git checkout -b feature/patch` using this command, you have created `feature/patch` branch and it is already checked out! Assuming you are familiar with git cli! 

2- Make necessary fix on current issues or spotted problems.
Only and only add one at a time to ensure you do not make mistakes on other parts anyway.

3- For example type `git status` to check recently changed files.

4- Once you found the changed and fixed errors on a file, type `git add /path/to/file` just copy path from the commandline after checking status, it provides you the path there. Alternatively, there are other ways, please do some research as needed!

5- Next, type `git commit -m "commit message of what/why change!"` Replace the text inside double quotes!

6- Finally push your changes into github remote branch by typing `git push origin feature/patch`

7- You will see a link provided there in the cli. Click and goto github. Create pull request is there, click and you are all set. Then I will confirm changes or add comments to your changes and we will go from there and finally merge the code in the master branch.




## Available Scripts
### `npm audit fix --force` to address all issues in shell

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject` but I recommend custom one I put: `npx kill-port 3000` update npm if it does not work!

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
