      <h1>Why Islam is the Salvation? </h1>
      <p>Islam teaches that salvation and redemption can be achieved through submission to the will of God and following His commandments as outlined in the Quran. It is believed that by following the Five Pillars of Islam and living a righteous life, one can attain salvation and enter paradise in the afterlife.</p>
      <p>Islam also teaches that all other religions have been corrupted over time, and that the original message of God has been lost or distorted. However, Islam is the only religion that has been preserved in its pure form through the teachings of the prophet Muhammad and the Quran.</p>
      <p>Islam also emphasizes the importance of good deeds and the concept of accountability for one's actions in this life. It teaches that every action has consequences and that one will be judged by God based on their actions in this life.</p>
